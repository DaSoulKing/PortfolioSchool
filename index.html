            <p id="AboutMe">
                My full name is Hamza Cheema and I am a student at William
                Floyd High School. I am currently 14 years old and I am
                in 10th grade. I have a normal sized family with my mom,
                dad, younger sister, and older brother. My family is
                from Pakistan and my mom, dad, and brother were all
                born there however, me and my sister were born here
                in Long Island. I have a passion for knowledge and
                because of that I am in many clubs and activities
                in school and outside of school. The clubs I am
                in are Youth and Government and Muslim Student
                Association, this year I plan on joining 3 more
                clubs which are, Student Government, Robotics,
                and Future Business Leaders of America. I am
                also currently in wrestling though it has not
                begun this year yet. My previous elective
                course was Drawing and Design. I don't have a
                favorite class but my favorite type of class
                is any tech class. When I am out of school I like to
                either play video games or code whether that be
                coding games, websites, or simulations. When I finish
                high school I plan to go to college/university for a degree
                in software engineering and possibly hardware engineering 
                as well. While in college I plan to find small businesses
                on yelp and code websites for them for some money. Then
                I plan to start a job in software engineering and have a 
                website developing side hustle. One fun fact about me
                is that I am pretty good at a mini-game called Bed-Wars within a server called Hypixel
                inside of the game Minecraft.
